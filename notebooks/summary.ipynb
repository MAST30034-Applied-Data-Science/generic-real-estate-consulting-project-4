    "# Introduction\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The RBA (Reserve bank of Australia) has been increasing interest rate since 2021, which significantly affect the real estate market. The house price has been dropping since then. Many house investors are considering selling their property to stop loss or leasing and waiting for a possible market recovery. On the other hand, renters may consider stopping renting and buying property to settle down. For both situations, rental prices are relevant because they can be viewed as a substantial opportunity cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target and Methodology\n",
    "This project aims to offer overviews and predictions of the rental market. We approach it using mainly machine learning methods because of their high accuracy rate and advantage in trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value\n",
    "The result may help ordinary renters position their target property to meet their needs. It may also offer assistance for investors in calculating revenue or opportunity costs."

    "LSTM networks are an extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) mainly introduced to handle situations where RNNs fail. Talking about RNN, it is a network that works on the present input by taking into consideration the previous output (feedback) and storing in its memory for a short period of time (short-term memory). Out of its various applications, the most popular ones are in the fields of speech processing, non-Markovian control, and music composition. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to RNNs. First, it fails to store information for a longer period of time. At times, a reference to certain information stored quite a long time ago is required to predict the current output. But RNNs are absolutely incapable of handling such “long-term dependencies”. Second, there is no finer control over which part of the context needs to be carried forward and how much of the past needs to be ‘forgotten’. Other issues with RNNs are exploding and vanishing gradients (explained later) which occur during the training process of a network through backtracking. Thus, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was brought into the picture. It has been so designed that the vanishing gradient problem is almost completely removed, while the training model is left unaltered. Long time lags in certain problems are bridged using LSTMs where they also handle noise, distributed representations, and continuous values. With LSTMs, there is no need to keep a finite number of states from beforehand as required in the hidden Markov model (HMM). LSTMs provide us with a large range of parameters such as learning rates, and input and output biases. Hence, no need for fine adjustments. The complexity to update each weight is reduced to O(1) with LSTMs, similar to that of Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT), which is an advantage. "

    "Autoregressive (AR) modeling is one of the techniques used for time-series analysis. An autoregressive model is a time-series model that describes how a particular variable’s past values influence its current value. In other words, an AR model attempts to predict the next value in a series by incorporating the most recent past values and using them as input data. Autoregressive models are based on the idea that past events can help us predict future events. For example, if we know that the stock market has been going up for the past few days, we might expect it to continue going up in the future. Or, if we know that there has been a lot of rain lately, we might expect more rain in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoregressive modeling is training a regression model on the value of the response variable itself. Autoregressive is made of the word, Auto and Regressive which represents the linear regression on itself (auto). In the context of time-series forecasting, autoregressive modeling will mean creating the model where the response variable Y will depend upon the previous values of Y at a pre-determined constant time lag. The time lag can be daily (or 2, 3, 4… days), weekly, monthly, etc. A great way to explain this would be that if I were predicting what the stock price will be at 12 pm tomorrow based on the stock price today, then my model might have an auto part where each day affects the next day’s value just like regular linear regression does but also has regressive features which mean there are different factors influencing changes over shorter spans such as days rather than weeks. AR models can be used to model anything that has some degree of autocorrelation which means that there is a correlation between observations at adjacent time steps. The most common use case for this type of modeling is with stock market prices where the price today (t) is highly correlated with the price one day ago (t-1)"
